- SLiM: Simulation of the rec-1 experimental evolution using the SLiMgui software (version 4.0.1; https://messerlab.org/slim/) and R
- Melting_curve_analysis: Protocol and code to analyse the rec-1 melting curves using a qPCR instrument (LC480).
- rec1Indel_primers: Contains primers used to amplify a sequence in the rec-1 gene (from Chung et al, 2015; DOI: 10.1101/gad.266056.115). This sequence contains the 8bp deletion. These are the primers used for the melting curve analysis.
