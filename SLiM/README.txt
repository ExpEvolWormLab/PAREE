### This directory contains files useful for the rec-1 experimental evolution simulations

(!!!) Warning: you need to change the path in both the R and slim scripts to make it work on your computer

* monomorphic_outputs: output relative to the "monomorphic experiment" simulations (rec-1 WT or mutant)

* polymorphic_outputs: output relative to the "polymorphic experiment" simulations (mix of rec-1 WT and mutant)

* scripts: the slim and R simulations scripts 

* input_data: input data of the simulations (CeMEE genotypes, rec-1 genetic maps)

* transitory: a directory where transitory files can be stored and subsequently deleted during simulations
